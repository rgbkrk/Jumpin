Square platformer written for an Embedded Systems class at Colorado State University, taught by [Wim Bohm](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~bohm/). The proof-of-concept was written in Java, and later ported to a combination of C and VHDL (which bred a particular style of handling physics). I've since lost the C and VHDL :cry:.
