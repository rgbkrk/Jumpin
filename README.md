Square platformer written for an Embedded Systems class at Colorado State University, taught by [Wim Bohm](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~bohm/). The proof-of-concept was written in Java, and later ported to a combination of C and VHDL for a Field Programmable Gate Array. This bred a particular style of handling physics, as we did not have floating point values. I've since lost the C and VHDL :cry:.

Sadly, the Java version of this game doesn't handle tight boundaries as cleanly as the FPGA did as shown in this incredible demo:
